        <p>I am a design student and I wanted to see what would happen if a blog theme was created with Christofer Alexander's approach.</p><p>The constraints of the context seem to be following: theme should be <em>unique</em> enough to differentiate itself from the existing themes, at the same time, <em>neutral</em> enough to be used by multiple clients without making them look-a-likes.</p><p>First, the <em>uniqueness</em> constraint. I looked at the themes populating the marketplace, looking for commonalities, I found that they had: lots of whitespace, low contrast, one-post-at-a-time, picture-heavy, colorful. My theme therefore had to have, correspondingly: high density of content, strictly black-and-white, multiple posts at a glance, no pictures, strictly black-and-white.</p><p>I began searching for such look. Newspapers quickly came to mind: black-and-white, high density, multiple articles side-by-side. And, newspapers all have about the same layout and visual style, yet nobody's complaining they all look the same. That design, evidently, works. Thus satisfying the <em>neutrality</em> constraint.</p><p>Next was research. I looked at front pages of newspapers, deconstructing each one to distill the basic "newspaper layout". I was looking at newspapers from the beginning of XX century because of a simpler layout â€“ I'm a one-man team, after all. Here's the newspaper layout:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../content/images/2018/11/--------------------------2-2.jpg" class="kg-image"><figcaption>The "styles" will translate to CSS</figcaption></figure><p>Then I made the layout into an HTML+SCSS page, then into a Ghost theme, and here we are. I hope you enjoy this thing.</p>
