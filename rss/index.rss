He was austere with himself; drank gin when he was alone, to mortify a taste for vintages; and though he enjoyed the theatre, had not crossed the doors of one for twenty years. But he had an approved tolerance for others; sometimes wondering, almost with envy, at the high pressure of spirits involved in their misdeeds; and in any extremity inclined to help rather than to reprove. “I incline to Cain’s heresy,” he used to say quaintly: “I let my brother go to the devil in his own way.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Doctor's Cabinet</title><description>&lt;p&gt;It was late in the afternoon, when Mr. Utterson found his way to Dr. Jekyll’s door, where he was at once admitted by Poole, and carried down by the kitchen offices and across a yard which had once been a garden, to the building which was indifferently known as&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://localhost:2368/untitled-3/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5bdc983cf0fb5c2ac83b64bd</guid><dc:creator>Anton Khamets</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 02 Nov 2018 19:12:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It was late in the afternoon, when Mr. Utterson found his way to Dr. Jekyll’s door, where he was at once admitted by Poole, and carried down by the kitchen offices and across a yard which had once been a garden, to the building which was indifferently known as the laboratory or dissecting rooms. The doctor had bought the house from the heirs of a celebrated surgeon; and his own tastes being rather chemical than anatomical, had changed the destination of the block at the bottom of the garden. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the first time that the lawyer had been received in that part of his friend’s quarters; and he eyed the dingy, windowless structure with curiosity, and gazed round with a distasteful sense of strangeness as he crossed the theatre, once crowded with eager students and now lying gaunt and silent, the tables laden with chemical apparatus, the floor strewn with crates and littered with packing straw, and the light falling dimly through the foggy cupola. At the further end, a flight of stairs mounted to a door covered with red baize; and through this, Mr. Utterson was at last received into the doctor’s cabinet. It was a large room fitted round with glass presses, furnished, among other things, with a cheval-glass and a business table, and looking out upon the court by three dusty windows barred with iron. The fire burned in the grate; a lamp was set lighted on the chimney shelf, for even in the houses the fog began to lie thickly; and there, close up to the warmth, sat Dr. Jekyll, looking deathly sick. He did not rise to meet his visitor, but held out a cold hand and bade him welcome in a changed voice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Better value that for the money</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses, broken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes, old Ireland’s hearts and hands.

Now, though the features of my picture alter and change, ‘tis not, however, unlike: the world eternally turns round; all things therein are incessantly moving, the earth, the rocks of Caucasus, and the pyramids of Egypt, both by the public motion and their own. Even constancy itself is no other but a slower and more languishing motion. I cannot fix my object; ‘tis always tottering and reeling by a natural giddiness; I take it as it is at the instant I consider it; I do not paint its being, I paint its passage; not a passing from one age to another, or, as the people say, from seven to seven years, but from day to day, from minute to minute, I must accommodate my history to the hour: I may presently change, not only by fortune, but also by intention. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>New Ghost Theme Created, Learn Why</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I am a design student and I wanted to see what would happen if I apply Christopher Alexander's approach to make a blog theme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The constraints of the context seem to be following: theme should be &lt;em&gt;unique&lt;/em&gt; enough to differentiate itself from the existing themes, at the same time, &lt;em&gt;neutral&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://localhost:2368/new-ghost-theme-released-deployed/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5bdc88c56351a5270677921c</guid><dc:creator>Anton Khamets</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 02 Nov 2018 18:57:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I am a design student and I wanted to see what would happen if I apply Christopher Alexander's approach to make a blog theme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The constraints of the context seem to be following: theme should be &lt;em&gt;unique&lt;/em&gt; enough to differentiate itself from the existing themes, at the same time, &lt;em&gt;neutral&lt;/em&gt; enough to be used by multiple clients without making them look-a-likes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the &lt;em&gt;uniqueness&lt;/em&gt; constraint. I looked at the themes populating the marketplace, looking for commonalities, I found that they had: lots of whitespace, low contrast, one-post-at-a-time, picture-heavy, colorful. My theme therefore had to have, correspondingly: high density of content, strictly black-and-white, multiple posts at a glance, no pictures, strictly black-and-white.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I began searching for such look. Newspapers quickly came to mind: black-and-white, high density, multiple articles side-by-side. And, newspapers all have about the same layout and visual style, yet nobody's complaining they all look the same. That design, evidently, works. Thus satisfying the &lt;em&gt;neutrality&lt;/em&gt; constraint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next was research. I looked at front pages of newspapers, deconstructing each one to distill the basic "newspaper layout". I was looking at newspapers from the beginning of XX century because of a simpler layout – I'm a one-man team, after all. Here's the newspaper layout:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2018/11/--------------------------2-2.jpg" class="kg-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The "styles" will translate to CSS&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then I made the layout into an HTML+SCSS page, then into a Ghost theme, and here we are. I hope you enjoy this thing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Dr. Lanyon's Narrative</title><description>&lt;p&gt;On the ninth of January, now four days ago, I received by the evening delivery a registered envelope, addressed in the hand of my colleague and old school companion, Henry Jekyll.

I was a good deal surprised by this; for we were by no means in the habit of correspondence; I had seen the man, dined with him, indeed, the night before; and I could imagine nothing in our intercourse that should justify formality of registration. The contents increased my wonder; for this is how the letter ran:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“10th December, 18—.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dear Lanyon,—You are one of my oldest friends; and although we may have differed at times on scientific questions, I cannot remember, at least on my side, any break in our affection. There was never a day when, if you had said to me, `Jekyll, my life, my honour, my reason, depend upon you,’ I would not have sacrificed my left hand to help you. Lanyon my life, my honour, my reason, are all at your mercy; if you fail me to-night, I am lost. You might suppose, after this preface, that I am going to ask you for something dishonourable to grant.

Whisper. The boy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietly in the black open space. Mr Bloom moved behind the portly kindly caretaker. Wellcut frockcoat. Weighing them up perhaps to see which will go next. Well, it is a long rest. Feel no more. It’s the moment you feel. Must be damned unpleasant. Can’t believe it at first. Mistake must be: someone else. Try the house opposite. Wait, I wanted to. I haven’t yet. Then darkened deathchamber. Light they want. Whispering around you. Would you like to see a priest? Then rambling and wandering. Delirium all you hid all your life. The death struggle. His sleep is not natural. Press his lower eyelid. Watching is his nose pointed is his jaw sinking are the soles of his feet yellow. Pull the pillow away and finish it off on the floor since he’s doomed. Devil in that picture of sinner’s death showing him a woman. Dying to embrace her in his shirt. Last act of &lt;em&gt;Lucia. Shall I nevermore behold thee&lt;/em&gt;? Bam! He expires. Gone at last. People talk about you a bit: forget you. Don’t forget to pray for him. Remember him in your prayers. Even Parnell. Ivy day dying out. Then they follow: dropping into a hole, one after the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are praying now for the repose of his soul. Hoping you’re well and not in hell. Nice change of air. Out of the fryingpan of life into the fire of purgatory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does he ever think of the hole waiting for himself? They say you do when you shiver in the sun. Someone walking over it. Callboy’s warning. Near you. Mine over there towards Finglas, the plot I bought. Mamma, poor mamma, and little Rudy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>An Uncustomary Will</title><description>&lt;p&gt;That evening Mr. Utterson came home to his bachelor house in sombre spirits and sat down to dinner without relish.

It was his custom of a Sunday, when this meal was over, to sit close by the fire, a volume of some dry divinity on his reading desk, until the clock of the neighbouring church rang out the hour of twelve, when he would go soberly and gratefully to bed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On this night however, as soon as the cloth was taken away, he took up a candle and went into his business room. There he opened his safe, took from the most private part of it a document endorsed on the envelope as Dr. Jekyll’s Will and sat down with a clouded brow to study its contents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The will was holograph, for Mr. Utterson though he took charge of it now that it was made, had refused to lend the least assistance in the making of it; it provided not only that, in case of the decease of Henry Jekyll, M.D., D.C.L., L.L.D., F.R.S., etc., all his possessions were to pass into the hands of his “friend and benefactor Edward Hyde,” but that in case of Dr. Jekyll’s “disappearance or unexplained absence for any period exceeding three calendar months,” the said Edward Hyde should step into the said Henry Jekyll’s shoes without further delay and free from any burthen or obligation beyond the payment of a few small sums to the members of the doctor’s household. This document had long been the lawyer’s eyesore. It offended him both as a lawyer and as a lover of the sane and customary sides of life, to whom the fanciful was the immodest. And hitherto it was his ignorance of Mr. Hyde that had swelled his indignation; now, by a sudden turn, it was his knowledge. It was already bad enough when the name was but a name of which he could learn no more. It was worse when it began to be clothed upon with detestable attributes; and out of the shifting, insubstantial mists that had so long baffled his eye, there leaped up the sudden, definite presentment of a fiend.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Matrimonial Grievances</title><description>&lt;p&gt;You can easily imagine what a father such a man could be and how he would bring up his children.

His behavior as a father was exactly what might be expected. He completely abandoned the child of his marriage with Adelaïda Ivanovna, not from malice, nor because of his matrimonial grievances, but simply because he forgot him. While he was wearying every one with his tears and complaints, and turning his house into a sink of debauchery, a faithful servant of the family, Grigory, took the three-year-old Mitya into his care. If he hadn't looked after him there would have been no one even to change the baby's little shirt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It happened moreover that the child's relations on his mother's side forgot him too at first. His grandfather was no longer living, his widow, Mitya's grandmother, had moved to Moscow, and was seriously ill, while his daughters were married, so that Mitya remained for almost a whole year in old Grigory's charge and lived with him in the servant's cottage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Estate Present, Owner Missing</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov was the third son of Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov, a land owner well known in our district in his own day, and still remembered among us owing to his gloomy and tragic death, which happened thirteen years ago, and which I shall describe in its proper place.

For the present I will only say that this “landowner”—for so we used to call him, although he hardly spent a day of his life on his own estate—was a strange type, yet one pretty frequently to be met with, a type abject and vicious and at the same time senseless. But he was one of those senseless persons who are very well capable of looking after their worldly affairs, and, apparently, after nothing else. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fyodor Pavlovitch, for instance, began with next to nothing; his estate was of the smallest; he ran to dine at other men's tables, and fastened on them as a toady, yet at his death it appeared that he had a hundred thousand roubles in hard cash. At the same time, he was all his life one of the most senseless, fantastical fellows in the whole district. I repeat, it was not stupidity—the majority of these fantastical fellows are shrewd and intelligent enough—but just senselessness, and a peculiar national form of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was married twice, and had three sons, the eldest, Dmitri, by his first wife, and two, Ivan and Alexey, by his second. Fyodor Pavlovitch's first wife, Adelaïda Ivanovna, belonged to a fairly rich and distinguished noble family, also landowners in our district, the Miüsovs. How it came to pass that an heiress, who was also a beauty, and moreover one of those vigorous, intelligent girls, so common in this generation, but sometimes also to be found in the last, could have married such a worthless, puny weakling, as we all called him, I won't attempt to explain. I knew a young lady of the last “romantic” generation who after some years of an enigmatic passion for a gentleman, whom she might quite easily have married at any moment, invented insuperable obstacles to their union, and ended by throwing herself one stormy night into a rather deep and rapid river from a high bank, almost a precipice, and so perished, entirely to satisfy her own caprice, and to be like Shakespeare's Ophelia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
